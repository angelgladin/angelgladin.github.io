[![.github/workflows/hugo.yml](https://github.com/angelgladin/angelgladin.github.io/actions/workflows/hugo.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/angelgladin/angelgladin.github.io/actions/workflows/hugo.yml)

This repository contains a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) project for building my personal website.

A static site will be generated through [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the 
[`m10c` theme](https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c). A new version of the website will be deployed every single time a commit is made through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with the following [config file](/.github/workflows/hugo.yml).


This website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
