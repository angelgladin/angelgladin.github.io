[![.github/workflows/hugo.yml](https://github.com/angelgladin/angelgladin.github.io/actions/workflows/hugo.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/angelgladin/angelgladin.github.io/actions/workflows/hugo.yml)

This repository contains a static site generator of my personal website.

The website was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the 
[`m10c` theme](https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c). A website will be deployed through GitHub Actions with this [config file](/.github/workflows/hugo.yml).
